# Custom widgets support

This module registers component `widgetmanager` to allow to create custom widgets.

## Installation

Download the module `.zip` file and extract it into the Zabbix frontend `modules` directory.
Because Zabbix modules are loaded in alphabetical order by their directory name, the widget manager module
should be installed in a directory named `_widgetmanager` (the underscore is important to ensure the module is loaded first).
